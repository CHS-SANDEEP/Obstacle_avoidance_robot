# Obstacle_avoidance_robot

This project developed an obstacle avoiding robot
which can move without any collision by sensing obstacles on its
course with the help of an ultrasonic distance sensor. The Obstacle
avoiding robot is achieved by using Arduino Uno, The main
component behind this robot is the ATmega328p microcontroller which
is the brain of this robot. Arduino Uno due to its increased popularity
finds its varied range of applications.
